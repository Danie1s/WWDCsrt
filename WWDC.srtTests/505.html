<span class="sentence"><span data-start="591.0" data-end="593.0">

experience of your apps.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="695.0" data-end="697.0"> 
So, let's jump right in.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="697.0" data-end="698.0"> 
Let's look at live photo effects </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="699.0" data-end="699.0"> 
that were announced in the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="699.0" data-end="700.0"> 
keynote on Monday.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="701.0" data-end="703.0"> 
So, live photo effects include </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="703.0" data-end="705.0"> 
these loops, which are created </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="705.0" data-end="707.0"> 
by carefully analyzing the video </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="707.0" data-end="708.0"> 
and seamlessly stitching them </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="708.0" data-end="711.0"> 
together into these endless </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="711.0" data-end="712.0"> 
loops.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="712.0" data-end="715.0"> 
Also, include bounce which works </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="715.0" data-end="716.0"> 
in a similar way, but as you can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="716.0" data-end="718.0"> 
see, it works better with dogs.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="719.0" data-end="721.0"> 
And finally, there is long </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="721.0" data-end="723.0"> 
exposure, which analyzes the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="723.0" data-end="725.0"> 
video frames in a live photo to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="725.0" data-end="726.0"> 
create these amazing looking </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="726.0" data-end="727.0"> 
stills.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="727.0" data-end="730.0"> 
So, we believe users are going </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="730.0" data-end="731.0"> 
to have a lot of fun with these, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="731.0" data-end="732.0"> 
and we're also really excited </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="732.0" data-end="733.0"> 
for what you come up with in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="733.0" data-end="734.0"> 
your apps when integrating with </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="734.0" data-end="736.0"> 
these new kind of media types.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="737.0" data-end="738.0"> 
So, let's look at how you would </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="738.0" data-end="738.0"> 
do that.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="738.0" data-end="742.0"> 
Let's look at some code.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="742.0" data-end="744.0"> 
So, these are the PhotoKit Media </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="744.0" data-end="745.0"> 
types that currently exist.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="746.0" data-end="747.0"> 
They're great, they describe </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="747.0" data-end="749.0"> 
what Asset is, but what's even </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="749.0" data-end="750.0"> 
more important is how the asset </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="751.0" data-end="751.0"> 
gets presented.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="752.0" data-end="753.0"> 
And let me explain what I mean </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="753.0" data-end="754.0"> 
by that.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="754.0" data-end="756.0"> 
So, if a user shot a video, they </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="756.0" data-end="758.0"> 
would really like to see and use </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="758.0" data-end="760.0"> 
that asset as a video in your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="760.0" data-end="760.0"> 
app.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="761.0" data-end="763.0"> 
If they shot a live photo, they </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="763.0" data-end="765.0"> 
care equally about the still </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="765.0" data-end="766.0"> 
part and the video part.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="766.0" data-end="767.0"> 
So, they would like to see that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="767.0" data-end="769.0"> 
asset as a live photo in your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="769.0" data-end="769.0"> 
app.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="770.0" data-end="771.0"> 
To do this currently, you would </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="771.0" data-end="773.0"> 
look at these three media types.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="773.0" data-end="775.0"> 
Image, video and photo live to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="775.0" data-end="776.0"> 
do the right thing.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="777.0" data-end="779.0"> 
With live photo effects this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="779.0" data-end="781.0"> 
become a bit more muddy and to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="781.0" data-end="782.0"> 
make this really easy to get </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="782.0" data-end="783.0"> 
right, since it's so important, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="784.0" data-end="786.0"> 
this year in iOS 11, we're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="786.0" data-end="787.0"> 
introducing a new property of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="791.0" data-end="792.0"> 
Now, PlaybackStyle is the single </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="792.0" data-end="793.0"> 
property you can look at to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="793.0" data-end="795.0"> 
determine which kind of image </span></span>

kind of UI limits should </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="800.0" data-end="801.0"> 
accompany the view.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="802.0" data-end="804.0"> 
So, the PhotoKit has been </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="804.0" data-end="806.0"> 
updated to cover all these new </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="806.0" data-end="807.0"> 
playback styles, but I'd like to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="807.0" data-end="809.0"> 
go into detail on three of them </span></span>

animated.</span></span>

image data from the image manger </span></span>

iCloud Photo Library.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="917.0" data-end="918.0"> 
really great because users can </span></span>

some users who have really large </span></span>

many photos? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="935.0" data-end="937.0"> 
Well, to get 100,000 photos, you </span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="965.0" data-end="966.0"> 
They decide to download it and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="966.0" data-end="967.0"> 
give it a try.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="967.0" data-end="968.0"> 
And the first thing they see </span></span>

when they start using your app, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="970.0" data-end="970.0"> 
is this.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="974.0" data-end="975.0"> 
Now, spinner for multiple </span></span>

experience.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="978.0" data-end="980.0"> 
And this user might uninstall </span></span>

your app right away, or even </span></span>

worse, leave a bad review.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="984.0" data-end="986.0"> 
So, you might be thinking, well </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="986.0" data-end="988.0"> 
my app wouldn't do that, or if </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="988.0" data-end="991.0"> 
it does, I'm using PhotoKit and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="991.0" data-end="992.0"> 
this user has a really large </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="992.0" data-end="993.0"> 
So, maybe this is to be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="993.0" data-end="994.0"> 
expected.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="996.0" data-end="997.0"> 
PhotoKit was designed from the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="997.0" data-end="999.0"> 
beginning to be really fast and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1002.0" data-end="1003.0"> 
But there are some common </span></span>

mistakes clients make that can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1004.0" data-end="1005.0"> 
mean the difference between </span></span>

operation taking 10 </span></span>

milliseconds, and 10 seconds.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1010.0" data-end="1012.0"> 
So, how do I fix this? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1012.0" data-end="1013.0"> 
Well, since it's so easy to end </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1013.0" data-end="1014.0"> 
up with something taking a long </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1014.0" data-end="1018.0"> 
time, step number 1 is to test </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1018.0" data-end="1019.0"> 
your app with a large photo </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1019.0" data-end="1020.0"> 
library.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1021.0" data-end="1022.0"> 
Now we already covered, it's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1022.0" data-end="1023.0"> 
kind of difficult to get that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1023.0" data-end="1024.0"> 
many photos using the camera </span></span>

app.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1025.0" data-end="1027.0"> 
So, this year we want to make </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1027.0" data-end="1028.0"> 
that really easy.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1028.0" data-end="1029.0"> 
So, we're providing a sample app </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1029.0" data-end="1031.0"> 
that you can download called </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1031.0" data-end="1032.0"> 
photo library filler.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1033.0" data-end="1034.0"> 
Download this app and install it </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1034.0" data-end="1035.0"> 
on your test device.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1035.0" data-end="1037.0"> 
It will quickly generate a large </span></span>

library for you to use for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1038.0" data-end="1039.0"> 
testing.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1040.0" data-end="1041.0"> 
So, great.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1042.0" data-end="1046.0"> 
</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1046.0" data-end="1048.0"> 
So, great you have a large </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1048.0" data-end="1049.0"> 
library, you test your app.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1050.0" data-end="1051.0"> 
Chances are you might start </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1051.0" data-end="1051.0"> 
seeing some delays.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1052.0" data-end="1054.0"> 
So, I'd like to talk about two </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1054.0" data-end="1055.0"> 
common problems clients have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1055.0" data-end="1056.0"> 
with PhotoKit and their </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1056.0" data-end="1057.0"> 
solutions.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1058.0" data-end="1061.0"> 
So, let's look at some code.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1061.0" data-end="1063.0"> 
So, this is how you fetch assets </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1063.0" data-end="1064.0"> 
from the users' photos library.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1064.0" data-end="1065.0"> 
There are two parts to this.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1065.0" data-end="1066.0"> 
There is the database fetching </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1066.0" data-end="1068.0"> 
part, and then dealing with a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1068.0" data-end="1068.0"> 
result.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1069.0" data-end="1071.0"> 
Let's focus on the database </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1071.0" data-end="1072.0"> 
fetching part first.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1072.0" data-end="1074.0"> 
So, here we're fetching all </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1074.0" data-end="1075.0"> 
assets on the library, but we're </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1075.0" data-end="1077.0"> 
filtering with a filter </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1077.0" data-end="1079.0"> 
predicate on favorite assets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1079.0" data-end="1081.0"> 
And we're sorting by creating </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1082.0" data-end="1082.0"> 
day.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1082.0" data-end="1083.0"> 
If you're doing this kind of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1083.0" data-end="1085.0"> 
custom fetches, they are </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1085.0" data-end="1086.0"> 
definitely supported, but if you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1086.0" data-end="1088.0"> 
start seeing delays in these </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1088.0" data-end="1089.0"> 
kind of custom fetches, it's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1089.0" data-end="1091.0"> 
definitely worth trying to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1091.0" data-end="1093.0"> 
simplify the predicate or </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1093.0" data-end="1094.0"> 
simplify the sort descriptor.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1094.0" data-end="1096.0"> 
And that can mean the difference </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1096.0" data-end="1098.0"> 
between this query taking 10 </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1098.0" data-end="1100.0"> 
milliseconds and 10 seconds.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1100.0" data-end="1102.0"> 
The reason for this drastic </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1102.0" data-end="1104.0"> 
difference is that you might end </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1104.0" data-end="1106.0"> 
up outside the optimized path in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1106.0" data-end="1108.0"> 
the database and trying to get </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1108.0" data-end="1109.0"> 
back into the optimized path can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1109.0" data-end="1110.0"> 
really pay off.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1112.0" data-end="1113.0"> 
So, even better than doing these </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1113.0" data-end="1115.0"> 
kind of custom fetches, is to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1115.0" data-end="1116.0"> 
avoid them if it's possible.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1117.0" data-end="1118.0"> 
So, in this case we can actually </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1118.0" data-end="1120.0"> 
fetch the user's favorite smart </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1120.0" data-end="1122.0"> 
album and then fetch the assets </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1122.0" data-end="1123.0"> 
inside of the smart album.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1123.0" data-end="1125.0"> 
That gives both the predicate </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1125.0" data-end="1126.0"> 
and the sort descriptor for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1126.0" data-end="1126.0"> 
free.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1126.0" data-end="1128.0"> 
And you're guaranteed to end up </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1128.0" data-end="1130.0"> 
in the optimized path in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1130.0" data-end="1130.0"> 
PhotoKit.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1133.0" data-end="1134.0"> 
So, next, let's look at the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1134.0" data-end="1136.0"> 
result you get back from one of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1136.0" data-end="1137.0"> 
these kinds of fetches.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1137.0" data-end="1139.0"> 
So, this object is a PHFetch </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1139.0" data-end="1139.0"> 
result.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1140.0" data-end="1142.0"> 
Now in a PHFetch result looks a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1142.0" data-end="1144.0"> 
lot like an array and you can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1144.0" data-end="1145.0"> 
use it a lot like an array.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1145.0" data-end="1147.0"> 
You can ask for object and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1147.0" data-end="1148.0"> 
index.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1148.0" data-end="1150.0"> 
You can ask for its count, and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1150.0" data-end="1151.0"> 
you can enumerate it.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1151.0" data-end="1154.0"> 
But internally, a fetch result </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1154.0" data-end="1156.0"> 
works very differently from an </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1156.0" data-end="1157.0"> 
array, and is part of the reason </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1157.0" data-end="1158.0"> 
PhotoKit can be so fast and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1158.0" data-end="1160.0"> 
efficient with large libraries.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1160.0" data-end="1161.0"> 
So, let's look at how it works </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1161.0" data-end="1162.0"> 
internally.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1163.0" data-end="1166.0"> 
So, initially it just contains a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1166.0" data-end="1167.0"> 
list of identifiers.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1168.0" data-end="1169.0"> 
And this means you can get back </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1169.0" data-end="1170.0"> 
one fairly quickly.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1170.0" data-end="1172.0"> 
But as you start using it, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1172.0" data-end="1173.0"> 
additional work has to be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1173.0" data-end="1174.0"> 
performed.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1174.0" data-end="1176.0"> 
So, let's look at enumeration as </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1176.0" data-end="1176.0"> 
an example.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1177.0" data-end="1178.0"> 
And here we're starting </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1178.0" data-end="1180.0"> 
enumeration at index 0.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1181.0" data-end="1182.0"> 
So you only have an identifier </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1182.0" data-end="1184.0"> 
so far, so we need to fetch </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1184.0" data-end="1186.0"> 
metadata form the database in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1186.0" data-end="1187.0"> 
order to create a PHAsset object </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1187.0" data-end="1189.0"> 
to return to you in the block.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1191.0" data-end="1192.0"> 
Now, the fetch result is pretty </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1192.0" data-end="1192.0"> 
smart.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1192.0" data-end="1194.0"> 
It's actually going to create a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1194.0" data-end="1195.0"> 
batch at the same time.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1195.0" data-end="1197.0"> 
So, as we continue enumeration, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1197.0" data-end="1198.0"> 
index 1 and 2 are already in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1198.0" data-end="1199.0"> 
memory.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1200.0" data-end="1201.0"> 
And then enumeration continues </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1201.0" data-end="1202.0"> 
and you get the idea.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1203.0" data-end="1204.0"> 
It's going to access the disk to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1204.0" data-end="1206.0"> 
get the metadata for subsequent </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1208.0" data-end="1208.0"> 
assets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1209.0" data-end="1210.0"> 
So, for this kind of small fetch </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1210.0" data-end="1211.0"> 
result this doesn't matter.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1211.0" data-end="1212.0"> 
But I would image this fetch </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1212.0" data-end="1216.0"> 
result has 100,000 assets in it.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1217.0" data-end="1218.0"> 
Each batch takes a couple of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1218.0" data-end="1219.0"> 
kilobytes of memory.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1220.0" data-end="1221.0"> 
But when you have 100,000 of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1221.0" data-end="1222.0"> 
them you're looking at hundreds </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1222.0" data-end="1224.0"> 
of megabytes of memory usage.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1224.0" data-end="1227.0"> 
And even worse, each batch take </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1227.0" data-end="1228.0"> 
a couple of milliseconds to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1228.0" data-end="1228.0"> 
fetch.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1229.0" data-end="1230.0"> 
But when you have 100,000 of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1230.0" data-end="1231.0"> 
them, you're looking at 10 </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1231.0" data-end="1233.0"> 
seconds to enumerate a large </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1233.0" data-end="1234.0"> 
fetch result.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1234.0" data-end="1236.0"> 
So, enumeration is clearly </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1236.0" data-end="1237.0"> 
something we should try to avoid </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1237.0" data-end="1238.0"> 
if at all possible.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1240.0" data-end="1241.0"> 
We have found that it's almost </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1241.0" data-end="1243.0"> 
always possible to avoid </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1243.0" data-end="1243.0"> 
enumeration.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1243.0" data-end="1245.0"> 
And I would like to look at one </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1245.0" data-end="1246.0"> 
example of how it can be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1246.0" data-end="1246.0"> 
avoided.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1249.0" data-end="1251.0"> 
So, in this case, we're trying </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1251.0" data-end="1252.0"> 
to find the index of an asset </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1252.0" data-end="1254.0"> 
that inside a fetch result.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1254.0" data-end="1255.0"> 
Now, we could enumerate the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1255.0" data-end="1257.0"> 
fetch result and compare the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1257.0" data-end="1259.0"> 
objects we get back using is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1259.0" data-end="1259.0"> 
equal.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1259.0" data-end="1261.0"> 
But as we saw enumeration can be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1261.0" data-end="1261.0"> 
quite slow.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1262.0" data-end="1264.0"> 
So, even better is to actually </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1264.0" data-end="1265.0"> 
use high level API.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1265.0" data-end="1267.0"> 
In this case, we can use index </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1267.0" data-end="1267.0"> 
of object.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1267.0" data-end="1269.0"> 
And that is able to internally, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1269.0" data-end="1270.0"> 
in the fetch result be really </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1270.0" data-end="1272.0"> 
smart and compare the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1272.0" data-end="1274.0"> 
identifiers with the object </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1274.0" data-end="1275.0"> 
you're looking for.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1275.0" data-end="1277.0"> 
And array will define this index </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1277.0" data-end="1278.0"> 
without any additional disk </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1278.0" data-end="1280.0"> 
access or database fetching at </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1280.0" data-end="1281.0"> 
all.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1282.0" data-end="1283.0"> 
Same goes for contains object.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1285.0" data-end="1287.0"> 
So, I hope you have seen how </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1287.0" data-end="1289.0"> 
easy it is to get a large </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1289.0" data-end="1290.0">

the hints we provided to lay out </span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1542.0" data-end="1544.0"> 
So, you'll notice over here on </span></span>

the bottom right, if you can see </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1545.0" data-end="1546.0"> 
it, you can't because it's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1551.0" data-end="1552.0"> 
that is I can actually </span></span>

customize.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1553.0" data-end="1554.0">

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1560.0" data-end="1563.0"> 
I'll take this one, that I think </span></span>

would be a really great hero </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1564.0" data-end="1565.0"> 
shot.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1565.0" data-end="1566.0"> 
So, I can just drag that up and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1566.0" data-end="1568.0"> 
customize this layout.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1568.0" data-end="1571.0"> 
And they went a step further </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1571.0" data-end="1571.0"> 
than that.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1571.0" data-end="1573.0"> 
They let me customize the grid </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1573.0" data-end="1575.0"> 
itself in a really novel way.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1576.0" data-end="1577.0"> 
So, I want to give a little more </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1577.0" data-end="1578.0"> 
emphasis to this row.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1578.0" data-end="1580.0"> 
And maybe move this down.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1581.0" data-end="1582.0"> 
And I'll move this down to line </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1582.0" data-end="1586.0"> 
it up and you know let's do one </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1586.0" data-end="1586.0"> 
more.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1586.0" data-end="1589.0"> 
And I really like that.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1589.0" data-end="1590.0"> 
So, I could just hit the buy </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1590.0" data-end="1592.0"> 
button now, still within photos.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1593.0" data-end="1595.0"> 
Choose my size, this would show </span></span>

up in the mail.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1595.0" data-end="1596.0"> 
And I have this memory hanging </span></span>

on the wall in my den.</span></span>

<p>

</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1609.0" data-end="1611.0"> 
So, what you want to know is how </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1611.0" data-end="1613.0"> 
does this all work.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1614.0" data-end="1616.0"> 
If you're familiar with the </span></span>

editing extensions in Photos, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1619.0" data-end="1622.0"> 
you already have a good sense of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1622.0" data-end="1623.0"> 
how this works.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1624.0" data-end="1625.0"> 
We've added a new extension </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1625.0" data-end="1628.0"> 
point to Photos; </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1628.0" data-end="1630.0"> 
com.apple.photo-project.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1632.0" data-end="1634.0"> 
And we've added a new template </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1634.0" data-end="1637.0"> 
within Xcode that lets you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1637.0" data-end="1638.0"> 
easily create one of these </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1638.0" data-end="1639.0"> 
extensions in your own app.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1640.0" data-end="1643.0"> 
As you saw, in the demo, we </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1643.0" data-end="1644.0"> 
automatically discovered your </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1644.0" data-end="1645.0"> 
extension, raising the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1645.0" data-end="1647.0"> 
discoverability of your app on </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1647.0" data-end="1648.0"> 
the system.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1648.0" data-end="1650.0"> 
But we took discoverability a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1650.0" data-end="1651.0"> 
step further.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1652.0" data-end="1654.0"> 
By offering users a direct link </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1654.0" data-end="1657.0"> 
to the App Store that brings up </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1657.0" data-end="1659.0"> 
the App Store window, but </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1659.0" data-end="1661.0"> 
doesn't require them to search </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1661.0" data-end="1663.0"> 
for an app with that extension.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1663.0" data-end="1665.0"> 
It automatically shows only the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1665.0" data-end="1667.0"> 
apps that support that extension </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1667.0" data-end="1667.0"> 
point.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1668.0" data-end="1669.0"> 
And we think this is really </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1669.0" data-end="1671.0"> 
going to heighten the ability </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1671.0" data-end="1673.0"> 
for users to discover your apps </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1673.0" data-end="1674.0"> 
and quickly download them, and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1674.0" data-end="1675.0"> 
start working with them.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1676.0" data-end="1678.0"> 
So much so that we put a similar </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1678.0" data-end="1680.0"> 
App Store link in edit.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1681.0" data-end="1682.0"> 
And so, if you're already doing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1682.0" data-end="1685.0"> 
image editing extensions, users </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1685.0" data-end="1686.0"> 
will have a direct link into the </span></span>

App Store to immediately </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1687.0" data-end="1690.0"> 
discover you editing extensions.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1691.0" data-end="1693.0"> 
It's pretty cool.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1696.0" data-end="1700.0"> 
So, your extension lives within </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1700.0" data-end="1701.0"> 
the app, within your app.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1702.0" data-end="1703.0"> 
And that's really a great </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1703.0" data-end="1704.0"> 
opportunity for you.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1704.0" data-end="1705.0"> 
Because you may already have an </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1705.0" data-end="1707.0"> 
app in the App Store that's got </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1707.0" data-end="1709.0"> 
a lot of app specific code, but </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1709.0" data-end="1711.0"> 
you probably have some resources </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1711.0" data-end="1712.0"> 
and some other sharable code </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1712.0" data-end="1714.0"> 
that you could easily move kind </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1714.0" data-end="1715.0"> 
of into this extension space and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1715.0" data-end="1717.0"> 
leverage those.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1717.0" data-end="1720.0"> 
You obviously also have some </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1720.0" data-end="1722.0"> 
extension specific code that you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1722.0" data-end="1723.0"> 
would need to write.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1723.0" data-end="1724.0"> 
A very small amount.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1724.0" data-end="1726.0"> 
And finally, you just need to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1726.0" data-end="1728.0"> 
add a view controller that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1728.0" data-end="1730.0">

With all that in place, Photos </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1736.0" data-end="1739.0">

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1749.0" data-end="1752.0"> 
And when we do we send over a </span></span>

couple bits of data.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1755.0" data-end="1756.0"> 
So, in addition to the photos </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1756.0" data-end="1758.0"> 
we're sending you, the project </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1758.0" data-end="1760.0">

way you want.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1767.0" data-end="1768.0">

really simple.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1799.0" data-end="1801.0"> 
There's an optional property for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1801.0" data-end="1803.0"> 
supported project types and you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1803.0" data-end="1805.0"> 
saw this in the demo I just did.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1806.0" data-end="1806.0">

describe the choices you want a </span></span>

you want, you just want to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1811.0" data-end="1812.0"> 
straight into the extension.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1812.0" data-end="1814.0"> 
That's totally possible as well.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1814.0" data-end="1817.0"> 
And then there are few required </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1817.0" data-end="1818.0"> 
functions you need to implement </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1818.0" data-end="1819.0"> 
in your view controller.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1820.0" data-end="1821.0"> 
The first is begin project.</span></span>

That's where we hand you the </span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1824.0" data-end="1824.0">

info.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1826.0" data-end="1828.0"> 
And that's what we call the </span></span>

first time a project is created </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1830.0" data-end="1832.0"> 
with your extension.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1833.0" data-end="1835.0">

your extension and they decide </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1850.0" data-end="1851.0"> 
to switch away to do something </span></span>

else within photos, we're simply </span></span>

So, PHProject extension context </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1871.0" data-end="1873.0"> 
is a container for two really </span></span>

It's got a key asset, key photo.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1907.0" data-end="1909.0"> 
And what we've done in sub </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1909.0" data-end="1910.0"> 
classing that, creating </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1910.0" data-end="1911.0">

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1913.0" data-end="1914.0">

project the user created.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1926.0" data-end="1928.0"> 
So, it's really intended for </span></span>

that critical project data.</span></span>

layout information configuration </span></span>

rosters, things like that.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1944.0" data-end="1945.0">

somewhere else.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1949.0" data-end="1952.0"> 
So, we want that to be small, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1952.0" data-end="1953.0"> 
but useful.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1953.0" data-end="1955.0"> 
And we settled on this limit of </span></span>

1 megabyte.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1956.0" data-end="1958.0">

array of assetIdenfiers </span></span>

easy.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1961.0" data-end="1962.0"> 
They're just strings.</span></span>

</p>

So, setting the data, really </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="1978.0" data-end="1979.0"> 
easy.</span></span>

conversion both ways; from </span></span>

around the curation.</span></span>

We wanted to give you some hints </span></span>

about how we present those </span></span>

assets to a user right.</span></span>

difficult problems of things </span></span>

like grid layout.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2284.0" data-end="2286.0"> 
All right, you look at a memory </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2287.0" data-end="2289.0"> 
and we've done a lot of hard </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2289.0" data-end="2292.0"> 
work already in laying out this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2292.0" data-end="2293.0"> 
curated grid in a really </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2293.0" data-end="2294.0"> 
interesting way that's pleasing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2294.0" data-end="2295.0"> 
to the user.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2296.0" data-end="2297.0"> 
Wouldn't it be great if you had </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2297.0" data-end="2299.0"> 
access to that layout.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2299.0" data-end="2300.0"> 
And you do.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2301.0" data-end="2305.0"> 
But to do that, we had to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2305.0" data-end="2307.0"> 
establish first kind of set of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2307.0" data-end="2308.0"> 
rules, a coordinate system for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2308.0" data-end="2309.0"> 
you.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2309.0" data-end="2311.0"> 
So, if you look at the memory, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2312.0" data-end="2313.0"> 
you notice everything aligns to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2313.0" data-end="2315.0"> 
a very specific grid.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2315.0" data-end="2317.0"> 
It's grid of 4x3 aspect ratio </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2317.0" data-end="2317.0"> 
cells.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2319.0" data-end="2322.0"> 
But that's an odd, non-square </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2322.0" data-end="2324.0"> 
kind of dimension to share back </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2324.0" data-end="2324.0"> 
and forth.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2324.0" data-end="2326.0"> 
That's a weird multiplier for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2326.0" data-end="2326.0"> 
you.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2327.0" data-end="2328.0"> 
So, we simply divided that yet </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2328.0" data-end="2329.0"> 
again.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2329.0" data-end="2332.0"> 
And in this case, this layout is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2332.0" data-end="2334.0"> 
really comprised of 20 uniform </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2335.0" data-end="2336.0"> 
columns.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2336.0" data-end="2338.0"> 
What we call our grid spaces.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2339.0" data-end="2340.0"> 
And once we have this coordinate </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2340.0" data-end="2342.0"> 
system established, you can </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2342.0" data-end="2343.0"> 
scale this however you want.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2343.0" data-end="2345.0"> 
It's just a multiplier for you, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2345.0" data-end="2346.0"> 
for whatever your output is.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2346.0" data-end="2348.0"> 
Right? If you're rescaling on a </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2348.0" data-end="2350.0"> 
resizable window, or working </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2350.0" data-end="2352.0"> 
with web browsers of different </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2352.0" data-end="2354.0"> 
size, you can use this data to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2354.0" data-end="2356.0"> 
know how to layout the content.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2357.0" data-end="2359.0"> 
And it also lets us communicate </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2359.0" data-end="2360.0"> 
to you placement information.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2361.0" data-end="2362.0"> 
So, in this example, I have this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2362.0" data-end="2364.0"> 
photo that wants to live in the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2364.0" data-end="2365.0"> 
upper left-hand corner.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2365.0" data-end="2367.0"> 
So, I can now easily tell you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2367.0" data-end="2369.0"> 
it's at position 00.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2369.0" data-end="2371.0"> 
It's 8 grid spaces wide and it's </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2371.0" data-end="2372.0"> 
9 grid spaces tall.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2372.0" data-end="2377.0"> 
Next thing I want to talk about </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2377.0" data-end="2377.0"> 
are elements.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2380.0" data-end="2382.0"> 
So, inside the section constant </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2382.0" data-end="2382.0"> 
we give you an array of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2382.0" data-end="2383.0"> 
elements.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2383.0" data-end="2384.0"> 
And all the elements are </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2385.0" data-end="2388.0"> 
subclasses of PHProjectElement.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2389.0" data-end="2390.0"> 
And there's two really important </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2390.0" data-end="2390.0"> 
properties there.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2390.0" data-end="2392.0"> 
One, is placement, which we just </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2392.0" data-end="2395.0"> 
talked about and the other is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2395.0" data-end="2397.0"> 
something called weight.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2398.0" data-end="2399.0"> 
So, again going back to the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2399.0" data-end="2400.0"> 
memories feature.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2403.0" data-end="2404.0"> 
We talked to you about, like all </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2404.0" data-end="2405.0"> 
the intelligence that we're </span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2413.0" data-end="2415.0"> 
And so, our scoring system.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2416.0" data-end="2417.0"> 
And we wanted to share that with </span></span>

you.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2418.0" data-end="2420.0"> 
And so, we do that by given </span></span>

elements weight, right.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2424.0" data-end="2425.0"> 
it's a normalized weight from 0 </span></span>

to 1.0, the default value is 0.5 </span></span>

meaning it's not horribly </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2432.0" data-end="2434.0"> 
significant, but is not horribly </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2434.0" data-end="2435.0"> 
insignificant either, if that </span></span>

makes any sense.</span></span>

with that, right? </span></span>

significant ones.</span></span>

<p>

interesting, right.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2535.0" data-end="2537.0"> 
And we went one step further.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2537.0" data-end="2538.0"> 
If you notice we have </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2538.0" data-end="2539.0"> 
identifiers on these.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2540.0" data-end="2541.0"> 
And we actually repurposed those </span></span>

identifiers across images.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2544.0" data-end="2546.0"> 
So, if we know that this thing </span></span>

that's interesting in this photo </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2548.0" data-end="2550.0">

same identifier .</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2555.0" data-end="2556.0"> 
So, if you're doing like </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2556.0" data-end="2558.0"> 
animation, slideshows, things </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2558.0" data-end="2559.0"> 
like that, this is tremendously </span></span>

useful to you.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2561.0" data-end="2562.0"> 
Because you now can actually </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2562.0" data-end="2564.0"> 
correlated positions of images </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2564.0" data-end="2565.0">

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2566.0" data-end="2571.0"> 
S, I could keep going, in a code </span></span>

walk.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2572.0" data-end="2575.0"> 
But, I'd rather give you a demo.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2577.0" data-end="2578.0"> 
Because I think it's really </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2578.0" data-end="2580.0"> 
important to show you just how </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2580.0" data-end="2582.0"> 
easy it is to create one of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2582.0" data-end="2583.0"> 
these extensions.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2583.0" data-end="2585.0"> 
So, I'm here in Xcode.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2585.0" data-end="2587.0"> 
And I promise I will zoom in </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2587.0" data-end="2588.0"> 
where necessary, so you will be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2588.0" data-end="2589.0"> 
able to read this.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2590.0" data-end="2591.0"> 
So, I'm here in Xcode.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2591.0" data-end="2593.0"> 
And I have a project I started, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2593.0" data-end="2595.0"> 
but it actually does nothing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2595.0" data-end="2595.0"> 
yet.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2595.0" data-end="2596.0"> 
The only thing it has are some </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2596.0" data-end="2598.0"> 
assets that a designed gave me.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2598.0" data-end="2600.0"> 
And what we're going to build </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2600.0" data-end="2603.0"> 
right now, is a slideshow.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2603.0" data-end="2605.0"> 
And the slideshow is going to be </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2605.0" data-end="2607.0"> 
the marriage of the content that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2607.0" data-end="2609.0"> 
Photos is providing and seenkit </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2609.0" data-end="2611.0"> 
to do a really compelling kind </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2611.0" data-end="2612.0"> 
of 3D animation.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2614.0" data-end="2615.0"> 
So, let's begin.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2616.0" data-end="2618.0"> 
So, the first thing I can do is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2618.0" data-end="2620.0"> 
just, I'm on the project and I </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2620.0" data-end="2621.0"> 
have this little plus button </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2621.0" data-end="2622.0"> 
here at the bottom add a target.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2624.0" data-end="2625.0"> 
And I'll just add a target here.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2625.0" data-end="2627.0"> 
And you'll notice we've got this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2627.0" data-end="2630.0"> 
new template, right for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2630.0" data-end="2632.0"> 
PhotoProject extension.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2632.0" data-end="2633.0"> 
So, I'm going to select that and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2633.0" data-end="2634.0"> 
I'm going to give this a name.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2636.0" data-end="2637.0"> 
Picture show.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2637.0" data-end="2640.0"> 
Hit the finished button.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2641.0" data-end="2643.0"> 
And yes, I want to activate that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2643.0" data-end="2644.0"> 
as a scheme it makes it really </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2644.0" data-end="2645.0"> 
easy to run later.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2646.0" data-end="2648.0"> 
And then, I mentioned that my </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2648.0" data-end="2649.0"> 
designer is going to need these </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2649.0" data-end="2649.0"> 
assets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2649.0" data-end="2651.0"> 
So, they're already in the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2651.0" data-end="2652.0"> 
project, I just want them, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2652.0" data-end="2654.0"> 
basically referenced from within </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2654.0" data-end="2655.0"> 
the extension as well.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2655.0" data-end="2657.0"> 
So, I'm just going to add those </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2657.0" data-end="2658.0"> 
via the copy phase.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2659.0" data-end="2663.0"> 
And that's the whole set of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2663.0" data-end="2664.0"> 
assets.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2664.0" data-end="2666.0"> 
I just hit add and with that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2666.0" data-end="2667.0"> 
we're ready to write some code.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2669.0" data-end="2672.0"> 
Now, if you're looking closely, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2672.0" data-end="2674.0"> 
you'll notice that Xcode has </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2674.0" data-end="2676.0"> 
already added this group for me </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2676.0" data-end="2678.0"> 
for Picture Show for my target.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2678.0" data-end="2680.0"> 
And inside of it, it's already </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2680.0" data-end="2682.0"> 
laid down a view controller for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2682.0" data-end="2684.0"> 
me that conforms to the protocol </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2684.0" data-end="2687.0"> 
that we have to implement.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2687.0" data-end="2691.0"> 
So, I'm going to go into that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2691.0" data-end="2693.0"> 
and first going to add some </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2693.0" data-end="2693.0"> 
properties.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2694.0" data-end="2698.0"> 
So, just a very small set of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2698.0" data-end="2699.0"> 
properties here.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2699.0" data-end="2701.0"> 
I'm holding on to the context </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2701.0" data-end="2701.0"> 
that's handed to me.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2702.0" data-end="2704.0"> 
I have some arrays to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2704.0" data-end="2705.0"> 
differentiate landscape and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2705.0" data-end="2706.0"> 
portrait assets for my </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2706.0" data-end="2707.0"> 
slideshow.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2707.0" data-end="2708.0"> 
I have an outlet for my scene </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2708.0" data-end="2709.0"> 
view.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2709.0" data-end="2711.0"> 
And I have an animator.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2712.0" data-end="2714.0"> 
And I have two expected </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2714.0" data-end="2715.0"> 
compilers.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2715.0" data-end="2716.0"> 
I have not imported seenkit.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2717.0" data-end="2721.0"> 
So, that's an easy one to fix.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2722.0" data-end="2724.0"> 
And animator is my own class.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2724.0" data-end="2725.0"> 
I just haven't created it yet.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2725.0" data-end="2727.0"> 
So, let's go ahead and do that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2728.0" data-end="2730.0"> 
right now.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2731.0" data-end="2734.0"> 
So, I hit new, I want a Swift </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2734.0" data-end="2734.0"> 
file.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2734.0" data-end="2738.0"> 
And we will call this animator.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2742.0" data-end="2749.0"> 
And there's my animator.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2750.0" data-end="2751.0"> 
I'm not going to walk you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2751.0" data-end="2752.0"> 
through all of this.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2752.0" data-end="2753.0"> 
But it's really, really simple.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2754.0" data-end="2755.0"> 
So, I'll just tell you a few </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2755.0" data-end="2756.0"> 
things it's doing.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2756.0" data-end="2757.0"> 
When I'm initializing the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2757.0" data-end="2759.0"> 
animation I want to kind of </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2759.0" data-end="2761.0"> 
reach into the scene and get out </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2761.0" data-end="2763.0"> 
some specific elements of the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2763.0" data-end="2763.0"> 
scene.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2763.0" data-end="2764.0"> 
I want to find these tagged </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2764.0" data-end="2766.0"> 
photo frames in this 3D scene.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2767.0" data-end="2769.0"> 
And then reach kind of inside </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2769.0" data-end="2771.0"> 
them, behind the glass and get </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2771.0" data-end="2772.0"> 
at the material that is going to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2772.0" data-end="2774.0"> 
be the photo I'm showing behind </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2774.0" data-end="2776.0"> 
the glass of these frames.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2776.0" data-end="2777.0"> 
So, that's really all I'm doing </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2777.0" data-end="2778.0"> 
in the initialize.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2779.0" data-end="2782.0"> 
And then from that point, the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2782.0" data-end="2783.0"> 
scene, I know it's just going to </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2783.0" data-end="2784.0"> 
be spinning around.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2784.0" data-end="2786.0"> 
It's just this kind of rotation </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2786.0" data-end="2789.0"> 
on a table and I have a little </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2789.0" data-end="2791.0"> 
trickery that you're like a good </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2791.0" data-end="2792.0"> 
magician when you're not looking </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2792.0" data-end="2793.0"> 
on switching photos.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2793.0" data-end="2795.0"> 
And so, I'm just doing that </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2795.0" data-end="2796.0"> 
through a couple of timers.</span></span>

animation.</span></span>

So, we'll go back to the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2803.0" data-end="2804.0"> 
the interesting bits.</span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2817.0" data-end="2819.0">

slide, right? </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2825.0" data-end="2825.0"> 
So, this should look very </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2825.0" data-end="2827.0"> 
familiar with what we just </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2827.0" data-end="2827.0"> 
talked about.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2828.0" data-end="2830.0"> 
And then load data, I'm simply </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2830.0" data-end="2831.0"> 
reading that back.</span></span>

<p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2853.0" data-end="2854.0"> 
So, viewDidLoad.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2855.0" data-end="2861.0"> 
I just need to initialize my </span></span>

ask the user for anything.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2868.0" data-end="2869.0"> 
So, I won't fill that in.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2870.0" data-end="2871.0"> 
It's just a slide show.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2871.0" data-end="2874.0"> 
But begin project, obviously, </span></span>

I've got some work I want to do </span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2876.0" data-end="2877.0"> 
So, we'll fill that in.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2877.0" data-end="2880.0"> 
And what I'm doing in this case </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2880.0" data-end="2883.0"> 
is I'm getting at the actual </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2883.0" data-end="2884.0"> 
sections array.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2886.0" data-end="2887.0"> 
And I'm looking for the first </span></span>

section of typed content.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2890.0" data-end="2891.0"> 
Right? I'm really designing this </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2891.0" data-end="2892.0"> 
around a memory, like we just </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2892.0" data-end="2893.0"> 
talk about.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2893.0" data-end="2895.0"> 
And form that, I want the most </span></span>

curated assets.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2896.0" data-end="2898.0"> 
I want the top-level summary.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2899.0" data-end="2900.0"> 
And so, I asked for the first </span></span>

object in that array.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2902.0" data-end="2903.0"> 
From that, get the </span></span>

cloudAssetIdentifiers and I'm </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2906.0" data-end="2907.0"> 
good to go.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2908.0" data-end="2910.0"> 
Now, in the background, I am </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2910.0" data-end="2912.0"> 
just saving the project data so </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2912.0" data-end="2913.0"> 
that it's there later if the </span></span>

Get into resume project, and </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2920.0" data-end="2921.0"> 
that's really easy.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2923.0" data-end="2926.0"> 
I simply hold on to my context </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2927.0" data-end="2929.0">

the animation.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2930.0" data-end="2933.0"> 
And finally, in finish project, </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2937.0" data-end="2939.0"> 
I'm just suspending animation.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2939.0" data-end="2940.0"> 
I don't want these timers </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2941.0" data-end="2943.0"> 
running while user's doing </span></span>

something else.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2943.0" data-end="2945.0"> 
I just suspend it.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2946.0" data-end="2947.0"> 
And believe it or not, that is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2947.0" data-end="2949.0"> 
the entirety of the code for </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2949.0" data-end="2949.0"> 
this extension.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2949.0" data-end="2950.0"> 
That is my slide show.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2951.0" data-end="2952.0"> 
Now, what I haven't don't is </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2952.0" data-end="2954.0"> 
wire up the UI, which I can do </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2954.0" data-end="2955.0"> 
really quickly.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2955.0" data-end="2956.0"> 
So, the template gives me the </span></span>

view for my view controlled.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2958.0" data-end="2959.0"> 
I'll just delete the default </span></span>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2961.0" data-end="2962.0"> 
And I'm going to add a scene to </span></span>

this.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2968.0" data-end="2970.0"> 
And so, we add a seenkit view.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2970.0" data-end="2974.0"> 
I'll just resize that and just </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2975.0" data-end="2977.0"> 
pop in here, set my auto resize </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2977.0" data-end="2979.0">

And the only other thing you </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2984.0" data-end="2986.0"> 
need to do to that is choose the </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2986.0" data-end="2987.0"> 
scene itself, which I already </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2987.0" data-end="2988.0"> 
have in the assets that we </span></span>

loaded in.</span></span>

</p>

<p>
<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2990.0" data-end="2991.0"> 
And I just need to wire it to my </span></span>

view controller.</span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="2993.0" data-end="2994.0">

<p>

the app, obviously, it's Photos </span></span>

<span class="sentence"><span data-start="3008.0" data-end="3008.0">

<p>
